## About this Workshop:  

This full day workshop is targeted to students and other scientists who are familiar with and have used R before but are interested in learning more about the language of R and how to use it in their daily workflow. Specifically, workshop participants will learn to automate daily tasks, wrangle their data in a reproducible framework (using tidyverse R packages dplyr and tidyr), make publication ready graphs (using R package ggplot2), and write their own functions during the course of this workshop. Participants will be working on their personal laptops live coding along with the instructors and working through individual and small group exercises.
