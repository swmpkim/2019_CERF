```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Setup:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(here)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ebird <- read.csv(here::here("data", "eBird_workshop.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ebird <- dplyr::distinct(ebird)

wq <- read.csv(here::here("data", "daily_wq.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
wq_trimmed <- wq %>%
    select(station_code, month, day, temp, sal, do_pct, depth) %>%
    filter(!is.na(depth)) %>%
    mutate(depth_ft = depth * 3.28,
           temp_f = (9/5) * temp + 32)
```


# Final challenge  

For our final challenge, you are going to put together the things that you've learned throughout the day. You will write a loop to read in each of a few files, and produce a summary table and graph for each.  


## 1. Build up vector of file names

Station names are provided below. Fill in the second piece of code to make a vector of file names, that are the station names with ".csv" on the end. (Hint: look up `paste` and `paste0`)    

```{r}
my_files <- dir(here::here("data", "final_challenge"))
```



## 2. Write functions  

Write a function to calculate standard error. Name it `sterr`. Recall that the body of the function should look something like this:  

```{r}
sd( x, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt( sum(!is.na( x )) )

sterr <- ---------
```

Write another function to calculate depth in feet, from meters. The conversion is:  
`feet = meters * 3.28`  

```{r}
m_to_ft <- ---------
```



## 3. Fill in the loop structure  

# need to go over lubridate::year and month in dplyr script

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(my_files)){
    # find the file
    in_file <- here::here("data", "final_challenge", my_files[i])
    
    # read in the file
    dat <- read.csv(in_file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    
    # make a new column for depth in feet. 
    # also make sure that date is correctly seen as a date.
    dat <- dat %>% 
        mutate(depth_ft = m_to_ft(depth),
               date = lubridate::ymd(date),
               year = lubridate::year(date),
               month = lubridate::month(date))
    
    # make and print a line graph of depth in feet, 
    # where each year is a different color 
    
    # add in an informative title and axis labels, and do whatever theme/colors you want
    q <- ggplot(dat) +
        geom_line(aes(x = date, y = depth_ft, col = factor(year))) +
        theme_bw() +
        labs(title = my_stations[i])
    
    print(q)
    
    # now generate a summary table, by year,
    # to show min, median, mean, max, and sterr of depth_ft
    dat %>% 
        group_by(year) %>% 
        filter(!is.na(depth_ft)) %>% 
        summarize(min = min(depth_ft),
                  median = median(depth_ft),
                  mean = mean(depth_ft),
                  max = max(depth_ft),
                  sterr = sterr(depth_ft)) %>% 
        print()
    
    # Group by year and month, calculate only the mean of depth_ft,
    # and pivot the data so that months are columns
    dat %>% 
        select(year, month, depth_ft) %>% 
        group_by(year, month) %>% 
        filter(!is.na(depth_ft)) %>% 
        summarize(mean = mean(depth_ft)) %>% 
        pivot_wider(names_from = "month", values_from = "mean") %>% 
        print()
        
}
```
